Single axis anchors:
 1. Left (horizontal), can constraints: (align, pull, limit)
 2. Top (vertical), can constraints: (align, pull, limit)
 3. Right (horizontal), can constraints: (align, pull, limit)
 4. Bottom (vertical), can constraints: (align, pull, limit)
 5. CenterX (horizontal), can constraints: (align, limit)
 6. CenterY (vertical), can constraints: (align, limit)
 7. Width (vertical), can constraints: (equal(scaled, boxed, fixed), autosized)
 8. Height (horizontal), can constraints: (equal(scaled, boxed, fixed), autosized)

XY axis anchors:
 1. Origin, can constraints: (align, pull, limit)
 2. Center, can constraints: (align, limit)
 3. Size, can constraints: (equal(scaled, boxed, fixed), autosized)

Constraint types:
 1. Positioning (changes origin) - align
 2. Sizing (changes size) - equal, autosizing(height, width)
 3. Adopt (can change origin and size) - pull, limit

Constraints by applying sequence:
 1. Pull
 2. Limit // May be has unnecessary behavior
 3. Sizing
 4. Align

Conflicted constraints:
 1. Sizing(equal, autosizing) - Adopt(pull) in the same axis // pull changed size
 2. Positioning(align) - Adopt(pull) in the same anchors // pull already makes align
 3. Adopt(pull) - Adopt(pull) in the same anchors // cannot pull to different locations
 4. Positioning(align) - Positioning(align) in the same axis // cannot align by different locations
 5. Positioning(align) - Adopt(Limit) in the same anchors // align already makes position that conformed limit
 6. Sizing(equal, autosizing) - Sizing(equal, autosizing) in the same anchors // cannot

Can conflict constraints:
 1. Sizing(equal, autosizing) - Adopt(limit) in the same axis // limit can crop calculated size
// 2. Positioning(align) - Sizing(equal, autosizing) // 

Anchor possibilities:
 1. Evaluate constraints
 2. Resolve disrepancies
 3. Check on conflicts
 4. Resolve conflicts
